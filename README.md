The Xmath package is an easy way to write math in LaTeX. Xmath is an extension of frequently used mathematical packages with new commands for specific sets, arrows and operators. This package also implements useful shortcuts. The Xmath package mainly offers the following

* Essential maths packages.
* Cleaner intervals, sets, overlines, quotient sets and function presentation.
* Numerous commands for mathematical sets such as *Gal*, *Sym*, *Aut*, etc.
* Arrows for injectivity, surjectivity and bijectivity in short and long versions.
* Shortcuts for *mathbb*.

### Package content
The complete documentation is available [here](resources/xmath-documentation.pdf).

-----------------------------------------------------------
### Automatic installation
On **macOS** you just have to open the Terminal, to go to the
directory of the project and to write the following command :
```
$ sudo bash setup.sh
```
-----------------------------------------------------------
### Manual installation
On **macOS**, if this is the first package you install, you must
first create the following directory : `~/Library/texmf/tex/latex/`.

Once the directory is created, simply drop the file `xmath.sty`
from the project into it.
